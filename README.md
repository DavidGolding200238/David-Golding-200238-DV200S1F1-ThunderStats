ThunderStats

Overview

ThunderStats is a React-based data visualization web app built using the unofficial War Thunder API. The project focuses on clearly presenting information about aircraft, stats, and comparisons in a tactical, military-style design that's both engaging and easy to use.

My Approach

Development Steps:

Initially, I set up and experimented with the API in separate test projects to learn how to fetch images and data effectively.

Checked out other War Thunder API-based projects to get an idea of what was possible and to better plan my project.

Drew simple, clean wireframes to guide the project's structure and user interface.

Reused and refined code from earlier experiments and integrated it into the main application.

Worked separately on improving data accuracy from the API, though this was challenging.

Used ChatGPT to learn about implementing animated backgrounds and exploring visual design ideas.

Iteratively refined layouts and styling to closely match my original wireframes.

Key Features

Pulls dynamic aircraft data from the unofficial War Thunder API.

Filters data down to essential information for simpler viewing.

Comparison page to directly compare aircraft by speed, cost, and mass.

Radar charts clearly display four key aircraft stats side-by-side.

Timeline page shows individual aircraft progression over time, including changes in rank, battle rating, and repair costs across different game versions.

Simple yet visually appealing military-inspired UI.

Animated backgrounds and responsive layouts to improve user experience.
