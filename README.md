# ThunderStats

## Overview

ThunderStats is a React-based data visualization web app built using the unofficial War Thunder API. The project focuses on clearly presenting information about aircraft, stats, and comparisons in a tactical, military-style design that's both engaging and easy to use.

## My Approach

### Development Steps:
- Initially set up and experimented with the API in separate test projects to learn how to fetch images and data effectively.
- Reviewed other War Thunder API-based projects to explore possibilities and improve planning.
- Created simple, clean wireframes to guide the project's structure and user interface.
- Reused and refined code from earlier experiments, integrating it into the main application.
- Worked on improving data accuracy from the API, which proved to be a challenge.
- Used ChatGPT to explore animated backgrounds and visual design ideas.
- Iteratively refined layouts and styling to closely match the original wireframes.

## Key Features
- Pulls dynamic aircraft data from the unofficial War Thunder API.
- Filters data down to essential information for easier viewing.
- Comparison page allows direct comparison of aircraft by speed, cost, and mass.
- Radar charts clearly display four key aircraft stats side-by-side.
- Timeline page shows individual aircraft progression over time, tracking changes in rank, battle rating, and repair costs across different game versions.
- Simple yet visually appealing military-inspired UI.
- Animated backgrounds and responsive layouts to enhance user experience.

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the repository:
```sh
